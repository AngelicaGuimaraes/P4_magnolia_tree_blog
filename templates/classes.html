            <p>Magnolia Tree is a yoga studio for anyone who is ready to relax, work hard, laugh or let go. We believe that yoga is for everyone regardless of age and body type. Whether you can touch your toes or not, Magnolia Tree welcomes you and we open our doors and our hearts to helping you challenge your physical body and mind.</p>
            <p>We are a studio that offers Hatha and Vinyasa yoga classes in most levels. Their formats tap into static/still postures with longer holds between each posture. This can provide the student an opportunity to move deeper into their internal reflection. Regardless of the format, our classes will provide you an experience that leaves you feeling energized and uplifted.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to provide a genuine and sustainable yoga practice that will continue to evolve the physical and emotional health of our students. We are proud of the individual attention that our students receive. Our instructors are passionate about teaching and are always willing to take that extra step to ensure that no student feels left behind.</p>

    <br>
    <p>We offer to our students the possibility to choose between private sessions or group classes. Whatever
        makes them feel more comfortable with.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All our private sessions are created thinking specifically to fit the physical and mental needs and
        desires of our students. So, don't worry if you have any restrictions or if you think yoga is not for
        you. Our instructors will be ready to support you and help you to challenge yourself at every session,
        guiding you and assisting you so you don't feel overwhelmed, and take from your session, all the
        benefits that are expected.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It doesn't matter if it's to meditate or to give your physical body that extra energy, all our group
        classes are built for a maximum of 10 participants, so all our students can receive the proper attention
        from our instructors.</p>
    <br>
    <p>All our group classes have a duration of 50 minutes. During this period of time, our students can enjoy a
        very welcoming environment, work their bodies and minds, and also enjoy, afterwards, all the benefits
        that yoga and meditation bring to them.</p>
